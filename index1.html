<p>Georg Simone Ohm (1789-1854) was a German physicist and mathematician. 
He for¬mulated the concept of resistance to the flow of electric current. 
Ohm found that there is a direct proportionality between the potential differences (voltage) applied across a conductor and the resultant electric current. 
This relationship is known as Ohm’s law. The international unit of resistance, which is the ohm, is named in his honour. 
The work of Ohm marked the beginning of the subject of electric circuit theory.</p> 

<p style='color:blue;'>Sir Joseph John Thomson (1856-1940), an English physicist, is usually considered the discoverer of the electron. 
He was the first to open up the field of subatomic particle physics with his extensive work on the deflection of cathode rays (electrons) in an electric field, 
and he pursued further innovations in atomic structure exploration. 
He received the <font color='#FAEBD7'> Noble Prize</font> in physics in 1906 for his researches into the electrical discharge of gases and a knighthood in 1908. 
He also studied the behaviour of positively charged ions or positive rays moving through a magnetic and an electric field, 
and proved the existence of isotopes in a stable element</p>
